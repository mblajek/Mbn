Library for PHP and JS to do calculations with any precission, with correct approximations

	mbn.js - Library in JS
	mbn.php - Library in PHP

	mbn_test.js - Tests for JS version
	mbn_test.php - Tests for PHP version

	mbn.min.js - Minified library in JS

	index.php - Runs tests for booth versions and displays some examples (in Polish)

	Eval/* - Calculator based on library, with copied mbn.min.js and own index.php

Now versions of PHP and JS are not the same, PHP does not have some functions and some arguments, and has worse pow() function, will be synchronised soon.
